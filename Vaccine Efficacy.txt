DTP3 Vaccine Efficacy: 

Countries either give two doses with DTP1 and DTP2, or three doses with DTP1, DTP2, and DTP3 as per current WHO recommendations. Randomised controlled trials using these schedules have shown high and durable rotavirus vaccine efficacy in high-income countries but lower and less durable efficacy in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).

While PCV13 is recommended for most immunocompromised patients because they are at increased risk of severe infection, efficacy data supporting this recommendation are limited



HIB Vaccine Efficacy

Hib conjugate vaccines are highly effective in producing immunity to Hib bacteria. More than 95% of infants develop protective antibody levels after receiving a primary series of 2 or 3 doses. Invasive Hib disease in a completely vaccinated infant is not common. Although Hib vaccines provide long-lasting immunity, experts do not know the exact duration of immunity
