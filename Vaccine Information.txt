HIB Vaccine Age
Infants will usually get their first dose of Hib vaccine at 2 months of age, and will usually complete the series at 12-15 months of age.

Cost of HIB
In most developing countries or GAVI-eligible countries where Hib vaccines have been routinely implemented, the vaccine cost is estimated to range from US$ 1 to US$ 3 per dose

Mortality
Between 3% to 6% of Hib cases in children are fatal







ROTA Vaccine Age
The first dose of either vaccine should be given before a child is 15 weeks of age. Children should receive all doses of rotavirus vaccine before they turn 8 months old.


Cost of Rota Vaccine
All reviewed studies on rotavirus immunization in developing and low-income countries provide clear evidence that universal rotavirus immunization of children under 5 years of age is either cost effective or very cost effective at the vaccine price of US$7 per dose. However, this vaccine price is still expensive and not yet affordable by the healthcare system of these countries.


Mortality 
Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute and severe diarrhea in children <5 years of age and is associated with ∼600,000 deaths worldwide each year






HIB Vaccine Age
Infants will usually get their first dose of Hib vaccine at 2 months of age, and will usually complete the series at 12-15 months of age.

Cost of HIB
In most developing countries or GAVI-eligible countries where Hib vaccines have been routinely implemented, the vaccine cost is estimated to range from US$ 1 to US$ 3 per dose

for low income and middle income group, the vaccine cost per dose is range from $1 to $50


Mortality
many low-income countries have been able to introduce PCV into their national immunization program. Of the 73 Gavi-eligible countries, 60 (82%) introduced PCV. Despite this progress, 55% (approximately 74 million) of the global infant population are still not receiving PCV.2




MCV2 Vaccine Age

MCV2 should be given early in the 2nd year of life from 15-18 months of age.


Cost of MCV2 Vaccine 
do not find any information for the cost of MCV2 in lower income countries 

Mortality 
In 1980, 2.6 million people died of it, and in 1990, 545,000 died; by 2014, global vaccination programs had reduced the number of deaths from measles to 73,000. Despite these trends, rates of disease and deaths increased from 2017 to 2019 due to a decrease in immunization
