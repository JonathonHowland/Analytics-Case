# Analytics-Case

## Project Title
Iowa Analytics Case Competition 2021

## Description
An analysis and optimization of vaccine distributions for the Gates Foundation. The "2021 Iowa BACC - Data Set.xlsx" file contains the original data, and the "BACCForPython.xlsx" file contains the data in a format that Python can handle. The "Reshape.py" and "DataCleaning.py" files are for data cleaning, while the "DescriptiveAnalysis.py" and "PrescriptiveAnalysis.py" files are for the descriptive and prescriptive portions of the analysis, respectively. The other Excel files are intermediate files to transfer data between Python files, while the text files contain some additional information about the vaccines.

## How to Run Programs
In order to reach our final output, there are a series of specific steps that must be taken in order. First, the "BACCForPython.xlsx" file is necessary. With it, we can run (in order) the "Reshape.py" and "DataCleaning.py" files. Once those are done, the "DescriptiveAnalysis.py" and "PrescriptiveAnalysis.py" files can be run in any order, and as many times as necessary. Each Python program outputs its own Excel file, so as long as the code is run in the specified order ("Reshape.py" -> "DataCleaning.py" -> "DescriptiveAnalysis.py" or "PrescriptiveAnalysis.py"), any program can be run again without reliance on other pieces of code.
